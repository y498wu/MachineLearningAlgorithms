## SVM
SVMs, support vector machines are a set of **supervised** learning methods used for classification, regression and outlier detection.

### RBF kernel 3D Version
The previous two examples are quite simple and straightforward. It's either linear data (numpy arrays), or sklearn datasets.
I read somewhere that rbf kernel can be quite powerful. Not only I can use it for more complicated dataset, like plotting 3D scatter fig instead of 2D.
